    This is specifying the minimum version of the .NET 7 SDK that is required
    to build this project.  This is not the same as the version of the .NET 7 
    runtime that is required to run the application.  The runtime version is
    specified in the "runtimeconfig.json" file.

    We are using this due to an apparent issue with compiling a .NET 7 project
    with the .NET 8 SDK, at least without upgrading to Visual Studio 17.8.
    Since we can't assume that all of our users have upgraded we will keep this
    in place until we can confirm that it is no longer needed, or we upgrade the
    code to .NET 8 (which we should do anyway as it is the current LTS version).
